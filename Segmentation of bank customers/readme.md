**Task**: Analyze the bank customers and segment them according to the number of products consumed. Give the business relevant recommendations how to retain the clients. Test two hypotheses:
1) about the difference in income between those customers who use two bank products and those who use one;
2) about the difference in the average income between residents of different cities.

**Type of business**: banking.

**Summary**:
- Here I have identified the following patterns: most customers use one or two products; there are 16% more men in the sample than women; active and inactive clients are approximately equal in the sample; about 70% of customers use credit cards; approximately 20% of customers churned.
- I segmented customers by the number of products consumed and identified 3 segments: customers who use one banking product, customers who use two banking products and customers who use 3 or more banking products. After analyzing the data in the context of segments, I described the portraits of users in each segment and gave recommendations, how to retain the clients. You can see the detailed information here in the presentation.
- The average income of clients with one bank product and the income of clients with two products does not differ. The hypothesis about the difference in average account balances was tested in two versions: taking into account customers who do not have a debit card, and without taking into account. If we take into account clients without account balances, then the average values of balances for the two samples differ. And if such clients are not taken into account, then the balances on the accounts of clients from Yaroslavl and clients from other cities do not differ.
